## Introduction
This course was set up for new students in the EU-funded Innovation Training Network, "Lidar Knowledge Europe" or ITN-LIKE that started in 2020.

The open science course was set up to provide those students with a foundation in the philosophy of open science. It's based on discussion seminars and a set of self-study exercises that help students to try open science out.

We've also tried to structure the exercises so that students who want to invest more time in the course can create a portfolio.

ITN LIKE brings together 15 PhD students across Europe. These students are based at companies and universities, and all have different requirements to complete their PhDs. Because of this, we have tried to set up a course that can be delivered completely online, and independent of any one University.

And, because the course is about open science, we wanted to make the course materials open as well.

## Course Content

### The seminars
The course uses seminars to introduce the open science concepts.

The seminars are designed as an online interactive discussion for up to 10 students and one leader.

After the seminars we expect students to spend at least an hour on related reading. This reading is described in each seminar.

Most seminars will include a quick recap of previous material. This may be presented as a flash test.

### Self-study
Each seminar is followed by self-study sessions. These are described in detail elsewhere (e.g., [here](02_selfstudy1/readme.md)). The goal of each self-study session is to try out the concepts introduced in the seminar on something that is more directly related to the students' own work.

## Student portfolios
In the _extended course_ a student can choose to develop a portfolio of work.


## Using the course as part of a PhD study program

### Prerequisites
The course material assumes that the students have already had some experience in self-directed research. Because of this, it is probably unsuitable for use at the Master's level.

### When to use the course
The course is designed to help students adopt open science in their activities, so is best used before students get too far in to their studies. The course is probably therefore best in the first 6-12 months of a doctoral study program.

### Course duration
The course is structured so that students can choose between 60 hours and 90 hours commitment. This recognises that the lack of university affiliation may make it difficult for students to be rewarded for their participation in the course and so they may wish to limit their effort.
- The _basic course_ is around 60 hours (see [the course outline](../readme.md#course-outline)).
- The _extended course_ adds 30 hours to the _basic course_ (see [the course outline](../readme.md#course-outline)).

### Getting credit
**The information presented here is specific to LIKE students**
The course is not affiliated with a university directly and therefore students will not receive direct credit for this course.

Participants in the course will receive a letter confirming their participation in the course and a copy of the course outline.

## Student portfolios
Students following the _extended course_ will develop a portfolio of open science-related material that will be publically available.

## Reuse and remixing
You are welcome to reuse or remix the material in this repository under the terms of the license(s) applied to that material.

### Licensing
- The GitHub repository including e.g. `README.md` files is licensed under the MIT license (see the [license file](LICENSE) for details).
- Presentations for each seminar may be separately licensed by their contributors. Please check those documents for license terms. Note that the license for the presentations should be considered to extend to the source material for compiled documents (i.e. LaTeX source code is covered under the license for the PDF). Please also contact the author(s) directly to discuss reuse of their materials.

### Use of LaTeX Beamer materials
- Some of the materials in this repository have been created using the LaTeX beamer package. This was used because beamer-based presentations can be adapted and reused quite easily by changing the underlying theme. Some basic information about beamer is given on [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/beamer). We advise contacting your Communications or IT groups to obtain beamer templates that meet your corporate identity guidelines.

If you need help reusing the materials, or would like to check if you can use it, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/LIKE-ITN/OpenScienceTrainingCourse/issues).
