## Modular design
- [Modular design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design) enables interaction. If the interfaces in a modular system are clear, modules can be swapped in and out with ease.
- Modular design has also started to appear in wind lidar:
  - The e-WindLidar data formats (See [ยง4.3 in ](https://zenodo.org/record/2478051) and [Lidaco](https://github.com/e-WindLidar/Lidaco)) enable much simpler data exchange.
  - The [OpenLidar concept](https://zenodo.org/record/3414197) shows how this could be applied for wind lidar.

## Collaboration on confidential data
- The Power Curve Working Group's _assessment of wind turbine power performance prediction methods_ is an example of how commercially-sensitive experience can be shared without sharing information. [DOI: 10.5194/wes-5-199-2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-5-199-2020)
