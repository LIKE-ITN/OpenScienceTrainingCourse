### For extra credit
**Start your portfolio!**

Identify a suitable internet platform to share your experiences around open science. This will be your online portfolio.

Suitable platforms could include:
- LinkedIn
- Twitter
- YouTube
- Medium

Transfer your draft articles from the previous self-study exercises to that platform.

The portfolio should be findable by an internet search engine.
