Prepare a case study based on the work done in Self-study 3, Self-study 4, and Self-study 5. The case study should describe what was done to make your work FAIR and implement the R5 concepts, and how you communicated your work to your stakeholders.

Examples of suitable case studies include:
- Publishing your Master’s thesis through your university’s data portal and promoting it to stakeholders.
- Promoting results or a first paper from your LIKE PhD through websites like LinkedIn, Xing, or other social media
- Sharing code or other results through GitHub, Zenodo, or some other repository and sharing results with colleagues

__Deliverable__: Prepare a 5-minute presentation for [the Workshop](../12_workshop1/readme.md).

### For extra credit
Transfer the presentation to your portfolio in such a way that it can be read easily. If you only upload the presentation as a PDF or similar, add explanatory text.

Note: this extra credit work will require the student to work together with their employers to ensure that all legal requirements are met.

_4 hours of extra credit are available for this work_
