## Task
Prepare a case study based on the work done in Self-study 3, Self-study 4, and Self-study 5. The case study should describe what was done to make your work FAIR and implement the R5 concepts, and how you communicated your work to your stakeholders.

Examples of suitable case studies include:
- Publishing your Master’s thesis through your university’s data portal and promoting it to stakeholders.
- Promoting results or a first paper from your LIKE PhD through websites like LinkedIn, Xing, or other social media
- Sharing code or other results through GitHub, Zenodo, or some other repository and sharing results with colleagues

__Deliverable__: Prepare a 5-minute presentation for [the Workshop](../12_workshop1/readme.md).

__Passing criteria__: The case study must demonstrate all of the following to pass this assignment:
1. That the student understands how all or some of the FAIR principles can be applied to specific pieces of work
2. That the student knows how to modify a piece of work to improve its openness
3. That the student understands how to design and implement a multi-channel communications strategy to raise awareness about their work
4. That the student can critically evaluate their own activities and identify how to improve openness in their future work.

### For extra credit
Transfer the presentation to your portfolio in such a way that it can be read easily. If you only upload the presentation as a PDF or similar, add explanatory text.

Note: this extra credit work will require the student to work together with their employers to ensure that all legal requirements are met.

_4 hours of extra credit are available for this work_
