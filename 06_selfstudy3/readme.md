## Task
Working with your group, implement at least two of the ideas for improving the openness of your work that you identified in [self-study 2](../04_selfstudy2/readme.md).

Note: Don't put any effort yet into actively communicating or sharing your work. We'll discuss how to do that in Seminar 4, and try it out in self-study 4.

### For extra credit
Draft a short article about this. You'll use this later as part of your portfolio (see [self-study 4](../08_selfstudy4/readme.md) for details).

_4 hours of extra credit are available for this work_
