## Format
A 55-minute online discussion based around [this presentation](beamer/main.pdf), covering:
- What is intellectual property?
- How can we share IP but protect opportunities?

See the [notes from the seminar](notes/readme.md) for more information.

## Learning

### Goals
- Understand why we need licenses
- Explore the different approaches to licensing code and creative works
- Understand how the licensing process usually works
- Explore the benefits of modularised science

### Outcomes
- Students understand how licenses enable collaboration
- Students see the beneficial of open frameworks

## Resources
See 
- [`../99_resources/02_open_source/readme.md`](../99_resources/02_open_source/readme.md).
- [`../99_resources/03_open_access/readme.md`](../99_resources/03_open_access/readme.md).

## Further reading:
- [Modular design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design) enables interaction. If the interfaces in a modular system are clear, modules can be swapped in and out with ease.
- Modular design has also started to appear in wind lidar:
  - The e-WindLidar data formats (See [ยง4.3 in ](https://zenodo.org/record/2478051) and [Lidaco](https://github.com/e-WindLidar/Lidaco)) enable much simpler data exchange.
  - The [OpenLidar concept](https://zenodo.org/record/3414197) shows how this could be applied for wind lidar.
- The Power Curve Working Group's _assessment of wind turbine power performance prediction methods_ is an example of how commercially-sensitive experience can be shared without sharing information. [DOI: 10.5194/wes-5-199-2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-5-199-2020).
