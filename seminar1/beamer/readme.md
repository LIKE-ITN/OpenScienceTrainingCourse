## About this material
The seminar slides are written using the LaTeX `beamer` class.

You can create the PDF of the seminar slides by compiling `main.tex` using `pdflatex`.

For more information about using latex and beamer see e.g. https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/beamer.

### Why LaTeX?
- LaTeX data are simple text files and thus well suited for storage in a repository.
- LaTeX separates the slide content from the slide graphical layout, allowing it to be reused easily.
- I needed an excuse to use `beamer` again.

## Reuse
The compiled slides (i.e. the PDF) include a license statement. Please check that license for reuse conditions.

## Remixing
You should be able to modify the slides to use your own corporate identity by changing the theme.

### Licensing
If you do reuse these slides, please note the terms of the license described in the seminar slides may require you to acknowledge the source of the slides and the original author(s).
