# Self-study 2: Is your group's work FAIR?
_*How are FAIR and other open science principles used in real life?*_

## Task
Identify how open science and other data management principles were implemented in a recent paper from your group.

You'll use what you learn here in [Self-study 3](../06_selfstudy3/readme.md) and [Assignment 1](../09_assignment1/readme.md).

Results from this self study will also be discussed later in your presentation during the [workshop](../12_workshop/readme.md).

### For extra credit
Draft a short article about this that includes a discussion of how FAIR and R5 principles were, or were not used by your group. If something was not done, try to find out why not. You'll use this later as part of your portfolio (see [self-study 4](../08_selfstudy4/readme.md) for details).

_4 hours of extra credit are available for this work_
