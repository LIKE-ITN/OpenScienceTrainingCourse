## Task
Choose a recent paper or other publication from your group.
1. Identify how open science and other data management principles were implemented for that paper or publication.
2. Identify how aspects of FAIR or R5 were not implemented are missing.
3. Identify things that actively work against the open science principles.
4. Identify ways in which the open science characteristics of this work could be improved.

You'll use what you learn here in [Self-study 3](../06_selfstudy3/readme.md) and [Assignment 1](../09_assignment1/readme.md).

Results from this self study will also be discussed later in your presentation during the [workshop](../12_workshop1/readme.md).

### For extra credit
Draft a short article about this that includes a discussion of how FAIR and R5 principles were, or were not used by your group. If something was not done, try to find out why not. You'll use this later as part of your portfolio (see [self-study 4](../08_selfstudy4/readme.md) for details).

_4 hours of extra credit are available for this work_
