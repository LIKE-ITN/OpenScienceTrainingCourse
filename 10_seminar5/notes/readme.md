## What is a data management plan?

* A data management plan or DMP is a formal document that outlines how data are to be handled both during a research project, and after the project is completed.

* The goal of a data management plan is to consider the many aspects of: 
  * data management
  * metadata generation
  * data preservation
  * and analysis before the project begins

* This ensures that data are well-managed in the present, and prepared for preservation in the future

* Data should be taken to mean data _per-se_ as well as code!

## A data management plan template
There are lots of ways to write a data management plan. We suggest using [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/), provided by the UK Digital Curation Centre (DCC). This website provides a template for a DMP that meets most funding agency's requirements but is also quite simple.

There are other services, for example [DataWiz](https://datawiz.leibniz-psychology.org/DataWiz/).

## Publishing the DMP
You DMP is a publication, but you won't be publishing it in a journal. Instead, you can publish it through a University library, Zenodo, or other data repository.

## Updating the DMP
You may want to update your DMP in 6 months' time. You could do this by creating a new publication where-ever you submitted your first version. Alternatively, if you used Zenodo, you can just [add a new version to your existing publication](https://help.zenodo.org/#versioning).
