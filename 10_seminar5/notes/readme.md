## What is a data management plan?

A data management plan or DMP is a formal document that outlines how data are to be handled both during a research project, and after the project is completed.

The goal of a data management plan is to consider the many aspects of: 
 * data management
 * metadata generation
 * data preservation
 * and analysis before the project begins

This ensures that data are well-managed in the present, and prepared for preservation in the future.

N.B. Data should be taken to mean data _per-se_ as well as code!

## A data management plan template
There are lots of ways to write a data management plan. We suggest using [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/), provided by the UK Digital Curation Centre (DCC). This website provides a template for a DMP that meets most funding agency's requirements but is also quite simple. This has been chosen for ITN LIKE because it meets the needs of the funding agency.

There are other services, for example [DataWiz](https://datawiz.leibniz-psychology.org/DataWiz/). You may be required to use this or another service by your funding agency.

## Publishing the DMP
You DMP is a publication, but you won't be publishing it in a journal. Instead, you can publish it through a University library, Zenodo, or other data repository. 

As with any other publication you'll get a DOI that you can then reference in future.

## Updating the DMP
You may want to update your DMP in 6 months' time. You could do this by creating a new publication where-ever you submitted your first version. Alternatively, if you used Zenodo, you can just [add a new version to your existing publication](https://help.zenodo.org/#versioning). 

## Summary
Data management plans are a tool to help you think about your data. They help you take a long-term, coordinated perspective and consider how your data will be useful in future.
