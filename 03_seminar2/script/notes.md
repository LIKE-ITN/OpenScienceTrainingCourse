# Seminar 2: Data Science Principles

This is the script of Seminar 2, based on the first course held in October 2020.

    This script includes notes about the seminar. Notes are indented, like this text.

    The seminar was held online and was limited to 9 participants. This allows for discussion between the participants. 
    Participants were encouraged to use video to help enable interaction and questions.

## 1. Recap

    We took 2 minutes to discuss how COVID-19 had shown the beneffits and challenges of

## Project lifecycle

  - you write your proposa

  - 
  - logbook is essential for research
  - you'll generate data
  - data needs to be "wrangled" - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling -to find good, high-quality information. The key is to record 
  - Create a FAIR dataset
  
A FAIR dataset allows reuse and reanalyis:
  - analysis (e.g. checking for the presence of a turbine wake)
  - data annotation (e.g. These subsets of data includes a turbine wake)
  - analysis paper (paper related to the feature or information that has been discovered)


### Identifying the researcher
Persistent identifier for researchers (e.g. ORCiD) allows code, fundingm infrastructurem publications, data annotation, code, and the datasets to be connected to the researcher _and_ place the researcher at the center.

    Get an ORCiD!
    
### Publications
Typically people would only publish journal articles, but there are lots more opportunities
  - data management plan
  - data
  - data papers
  - code
  - code papers
  - traditional journal articles
 
This allows the researcher to generate more content and leads to reusable results and reproducible research. It also fosters collaboration between researchers. Ultimately it also gives the researcher more citations which can also be useful for career progression.

### How you publish things, matters!
The traditional approach is to publish an open abstract with all other publications behindd a paywall. By comparison, the Copernicus journals are open. This enables reusability and collaboration.

    Do open science journals have the same "impact"? Yes, and in many fields they are the only way to make contact with your readership. Some closed journals have mechanisms to make papers open, so it may be unfair to call a journal _per se_ open or closed.
    
    We shoud also note that when we pay for publication, that supports the review process, branding, formatting, proof reading, publication, promotion, and archiving.
    
    Open publishing and self-publishing will be discussed more in the "Communications Strategy" seminar.

Data or publications should be clearly licensed

Some journals allow you to add "assets" https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/5/73/2020/
