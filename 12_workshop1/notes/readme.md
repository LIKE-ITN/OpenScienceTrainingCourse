# Use cases for open science

_these notes are based on the experiences of the students in the 2020 LIKE open science course_

There are a few recurrent use cases for open science in academic R&D:
 - publishing a paper that uses unrestricted data
 - publishing a paper that uses data that is partly or totally restricted
 - planning a PhD and the associated measurements and analysis
 - executing a PhD
 - collaborating with others to create or update software.

In this summary, we will discuss the opportunities that open science brings to each use case, the challenges faced with implementing it, and the solutions that people used.

## Publishing a paper that uses unrestricted data
This is a typical use case for research conducted by early-stage academic researchers, for example early in the course of a PhD study. We'll assume that the authors just want to publish one paper.

|               |              |   |   |
|---------------|--------------|---|---|
| Opportunities |              | Increase the visibilty and citations of the paper  |
| Concept       |              | Allow easy access to the data, code, and results  |
| Approach      |              | Publish a paper in a traditional STEM journal, leveraging that journal's platform. |
| Solutions     | **F**indable | The paper is given a DOI by the journal. The authors provide multiple keywords that include broad or generic terms and detailed terms. The publisher allows the paper to be cross-referenced and indexed. | ![yes.png]() |
|               | A            | The authors pay for the paper to be _open access_  | ![yes.png]()
|               | I            |   |
|               | R            |   |
| Code          | Re-runnable  |   |
|               | Repeatable   |   |
|               | Reproducible |   |
|               | Reusable     |   |
|               | Replicable   |   |

### Going a step further
This paper combines the methods, data processing, and results. They could have been separated out into diffferent publications, each with their own DOI.
