Hugo
dealing with confidential data as part of a masters study
confidential data != confidneital science
can carry out open science with closed data
- anonymization
- psuedonymization
- encryption
The data itself can still be FAIR - e.g. DOIs, download using standard protocols
Used the Amneisa tool from OpenAire to remove identifying data. INtegrates directly with Zenodo. There is life beyond data

Priscilla
how to publish a paper. Looked at what was open. Papers are often in closed journals. Other FAIR aspects
- F - no PID, no metadata
- A - nto retrievable
I - no controlled vocabularly, no acceisble language (lots of acronyms!)
R - No metadata, no dat usage license
Improvement - PID; rich metadata, license
Colleagues were not aware that metadata could be published.
Developed a communications strategy with two strands; internal/slack/informal, and external/linkedIn/formal; major challenge was to make it relevant/interesting.
Are companies receptinve to open science? LAck of awareness, but interested in applying concepts (helps that the supervisor is "young")

Liqin
CAse study on making a paper FAIR / Is it open enough? are the codes and data FAIR and R5 conform?
DOI, and open access. "Electronic supplementary material" -> no open access to lab notebooks, data, images, and code.
Used videos to help make results understandable. FA, not IR. Author only published results, didn't want to publish code or data.

Another paper - open access, but code and background data not released (commercial / patent concerns)

Selling point - VISIBILITY

Wei
Masters thesis was not open or reproducible!
Looking at papers from others (Felix paper on cross contamination). Open access paper. Data and code are available on Zenodo. Includes all matlab scripts -> reproducible. Can learn from the paper.
Experience with implementing open science in a collaborative project wth another student. Including lots of code and results, but need to do a lot more.

Permission to upload data to GitHub? Implicit from supervisors. Not received any feedback yet because not published!

Shahbaz
Set up a new course for a course. On Github, with MIT license. Communicated it to stakeholders. Had to identify who the stakeholders were
**ACTION** get link to course
DMP needs to not include commercial information

Haichen
Publishing large amounts of data from a meteorological study. haichen6622.github.io/Westernghats. Produced pyhton code that can be modified easiyl by other users. Promoted directly to students and supervisors. What worked well - codecab be run. Website template is reusable as well! Could improve - python 3, NetCDF (fits community). Idea for website came from coursework

**ACTION** get link to website

Secondment at another R&D institute. Using own data to validate a model from other companies usng SCADA data. Trying to bring everything together to publish a paper. Initial approach is to just get results, but not see source code. Decided to use a third, open-source code as benchmark. Lots of data has already been published (has PID), but the results should go to a journal. Abstract source code into algorithms and metadata and contact person. Paywall is a major barrier to publication / use. More collaboration == more interst. Switchng to python was some work. Software carpentry can be helpful.

Treat OS as a trail.
Openscience - how to clear up the fog! Paper from Jose Palma. Worked through FAIR. Ran into a very quick problem - no data available. CChallenging to ask the question - turns into a communications problem; why should we ddo open science. Sharing a data management plan helped colleagues understand the ideas. Implementing open science in this context requires woeking with external companies. Need to use persusasion & examples. OPen science requires you to look into the future. Couldn't implement it yet, but 

Effort versus rewards
can get more visibility

Zhayou
Implemented FAIR and R5 for a wake study. Python on Github. But using lots of Fortran so fais on the "REplicable" aspect
**ACTION** age showing that Fortran is not replicable
Should we publish project meetings / presentations? Yes! Would allow someone to follow the path, so fits very well to reusable / repeatable idea. Could just have a single record in zenodo and then update it every week

Mohammand
Paper and code -> github. Published lab notebooks.
**ACTION** (ask for image from showing lab notebooks)
Linkedin, Research Gate includes statistics. DesignSafe - natural hazard research - includes metadata guidelines

Paco - Vicondar
Didn't really have knowledge about FAIR & R5 when doing it
Python for development. Repository. Includes tutorials. Heavy on documentation. DOI/ORCiD / ORCHID

Feng Guo
Publishing Masters Theseis outcomes (3rd Author). Goal was to make code readable. 600 readers for open version versus 100 for closed. Underlyiing data is not available.

PhD work - using a journal with completely open review process. Will commit data to GitHub and publish through Zenodo. New understanding will be integrated in to industry-standard tool. Uses Fortran too. Uses video to help communication

Dan Hatfield
FAIR / R5 seems not to be known in Canada!
Looked at an old paper he'd written; available through ArXiv preprint service. Don't have old code anymore. Code is on a personal computer (dead). Completely fails on FAIR. Research effort is basically wasted. Repeatability enabled by paper / publication. This is only 5-year-old work...!

Sai Wang
3 papers - 0/3 have accessible codes. FAI works, somewhat R. People working with legacy code worried about ability to share / post, think they need to reorganize.

Challenge - large data files can only be handled by specialist service

Alessandro
Confidential data from a third party. Difficult to reproduce with data or code, bbut even with it would meed input from the authors. Could publish intermediate results through Zenodo- Would increase impact! Need to switch to python. CAn still apply FAIR and R5 within closed networks. Do NDAs really have a big impact?
