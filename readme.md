# LIKE Open Science and Research Data Management Course

This repository contains the materials for a remote study course on **Open Science and Research Data Management**.

This file provides a basic overview of the course. For more details, see [the course handbook](00_handbook/readme.md).

If you want to get an overview of the course:
- check out the [course outline](#course-outline)
- read [the notes from each seminar](/blob/master/01_seminar1/notes/readme.md)

## Audience
This course is initially intended for the Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) in the ITN LIKE.

Supervisors are strongly recommended to accompany the course.

## Goals
- To educate students about modern approaches to open science data management.
- To enable and motivate students to implement these approaches in their projects.

## Outcomes

1. Students are able to recognize “open” and “closed” science and communicate the advantages of open science.
2. Students can identify the main steps in the FOSTER diagram.
3. Students are able to publish interconnected data objects, boosting their visibility and impact to the scientific community.
4. Students are able to list the main tools for Open Science that enable them to achieve the FAIR and R5 goals. (e.g. F - DOIs, A - GitHub, I - modular software, R - ...).
5. Students create a data management plan for their projects.

## Course plan

### Scope
The course includes 5 lectures, 6 self-directed study activities, and two deliverables.

### Hours
The course lasts approximately 12 weeks.

#### The basic course
The _basic course_ requires 61 hours of study time:
- 11 contact hours, and
- 50 self-study hours.

#### The extended course
The _extended course_ adds 30 hours of self-study to the _basic course_. It is designed for students who need to add hours for ECTS points requirements.

These extra activities are listed in the table below under the heading, **Extra credit hours** and described in each self-study `readme.md` under the heading, **For extra credit**. It should be possible to complete the _extended course_ in the same time window as the _basic course_.
