Outline for ITN LIKE Early Stage Researcher (ESR) remote study course

## Goals:

- To educate ESRs about modern approaches to open science data management
- To enable and motivate ESRs to implement these approaches in their projects

## Scope:

## Outcomes:

1. Students are able to recognize “open” and “closed” science and communicate the advantages of open science
2. Students can identify the main steps in the FOSTER diagram
3. Students are able to publish interconnected data objects, boosting their visibility and impact to the scientific community
4. Students are able to list the main tools for Open Science that enable them to achieve the FAIR and R5 goals. (e.g. F - DOIs, A - GitHub, I - modular software, R - ...)
5. Students create a data management plan for their projects

## Grading
Either a `Pass` or a `fail` grade will be awarded.
