# LIKE Open Science and Research Data Management Course
This repository contains the materials for the ITN LIKE Early Stage Researcher (ESR) remote study course on `Open Science and Research Data Management`.

## Audience
This course is initially intended for ESR students in LIKE. Supervisors are strongly recommended to accompany the course.

## Goals
- To educate ESRs about modern approaches to open science data management
- To enable and motivate ESRs to implement these approaches in their projects

## Outcomes

1. Students are able to recognize “open” and “closed” science and communicate the advantages of open science
2. Students can identify the main steps in the FOSTER diagram
3. Students are able to publish interconnected data objects, boosting their visibility and impact to the scientific community
4. Students are able to list the main tools for Open Science that enable them to achieve the FAIR and R5 goals. (e.g. F - DOIs, A - GitHub, I - modular software, R - ...)
5. Students create a data management plan for their projects

## Course plan

### Scope
The course includes 5 lectures, 6 self-directed study activities, and two deliverables.

### Hours
The _basic_ course requires 61 hours of study time:
- 11 contact hours
- 50 self-study hours.

The _extended course_ adds 30 hours of self-study to the _basic course_. These activities are described in each self-study `readme.md` under the heading, `For extra credit`.

The course lasts approximately 12 weeks.
